Fist, design an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) as a visual aid, prior to creating Tables in PostgreSQL. (see below)

We're tasked with priming raw data from JSON files via Twitter's API.\
Nevertheless, we'll consider the following questions before any unsupervised learning models can be applied and results analyzed. 

   -  Will I be able to easily hand off this data set to other teams?
   -  Does the data contain excess data that we donâ€™t really need?
   -  How can I get this data to be used to create great visualizations?

Then we'll download necessary libraries prior to analysing tweets with Python and PostgreSQL
<b>

 -    tweepy: Python library for accessing the Twitter API
 -   SkLearn: popular machine learning library
 -    NLTK: Natural language processing library
 -   re: regular expression library
 -   pandas: popular data analysis library
