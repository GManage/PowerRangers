##Overview


###Project Goal:

This project is trying to collect some data and performing sentimental analysis over trending topics related to covid-19 and covid-19 vaccines. We will be performing the ETL using python and SQL database, and also coming up with some machine learning algorithms to predict trending topics and hashtags since  supporting or opposing covid-19 vaccines has become one of the most popular and controversial topics around the world. The project will bring some meaningful discussions over whether getting vaccinated stands in the way of someone's personal liberty, forcing employees to have or prove that they have  been vaccinated as the requisite of returning back to the offices that violates employees' rights, and could there be upcoming class actions or foreseeable consequences of employers by enforcing similar policies given possible termination of employments or change of work arrangements.

###Questions We Want Answered:

###Communication Protocols:
- Primarily, the group communicates through the Slack App
- All parts of collaboration, including idea sharing, progress updates, coding updates, and meeting arrangements, are made through there.
