Overview



Project Goal:

This project aims to collect some data and perform sentiment analysis surrounding trending topics related to covid-19 and covid-19 vaccines. We will perform the ETL using python and a SQL database, and also come up with some machine learning algorithms to predict trending topics and hashtags related to the virus and it's vaccines.  The project will bring some meaningful discussions over whether getting vaccinated stands in the way of individual personal liberty, including but not limited to the topic of employers requirment to have staff vaccinated.



Questions We Want Answered:

Communication Protocols:
- Primarily, the group communicates through the Slack App
